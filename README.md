# Chronicles-of-Narnia
Here is my written program so far for the Text-based Adventure Game: Chronicles of Narnia


## Built 
Entirely with Java


## Description
A Java Text-Based Adventure Game based on the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This version allows the player to assume a character bearing a name of their choice and allows them to embark on an adventurous journey using their imagination, in saving Narnia from their treacherous foe, The White Witch. It is focused on reading and decision making, that is, players can observe that the storyline advances with every choice they make at the appointed time. Mainly for entertainment purposes, so feel free to notify me if you do not find it interesting enough.
